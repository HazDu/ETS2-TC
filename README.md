### Convert between Euro Truck Simulator 2 time and real time!  

ETS2-TC is a small program in which you can convert the in game time of Euro Truck Simulator 2 into real time and the other way around.
It's perfect for when you ask yourself: "I have 2 hours left to play, how long can my ETS contract be?".  

I have planned to release it in various programming languages. For now, these would be GML (GameMaker Language) and C++.

And if you like, you can also <a href="https://ets-tc.hazdu.de/" target="_blank">use it directly in your browser</a>!
